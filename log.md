  So, today I decided to make a classic game for my final project. I think I'm going to make a classic tamagotchi game, to be honest I still have no idea how to do the interface or the coding itself, but I will learn more from Sir Bagus, Sir Jude, Stavin and the internet of course xD.  
  The idea is:
  
      1. User can choose their own pet(s) (dog, cat and/or hamster)
      2. User have to feed and take care of their pet(s)
      3. When user forget their pet(s), the pet(s) will die and they have to start over
      4. a pet can grow up and it's for fun only, no rewards.
   
  *The Progress / The Concept could change anytime by the Programmer's need.
