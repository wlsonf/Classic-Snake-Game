  So, today I decided to make a classic game for my final project. I think I'm going to make a classic tamagotchi game, to be honest I still have no idea how to do the interface or the coding itself, but I will learn more from Sir Bagus, Sir Jude, Stavin and the internet of course xD.  
  The idea is:
  
      1. User can choose their own pet(s) (dog, cat and/or hamster)
      2. User have to feed and take care of their pet(s)
      3. When user forget their pet(s), the pet(s) will die and they have to start over
      4. a pet can grow up and it's for fun only, no rewards.
   
  *The Progress / The Concept could change anytime by the Programmer's need.
  
                                                                                          -wlsonF

   ------------
   
   since i think it's hard to create the interface for tamagotchi game, i decided to make snake, another classic game, the idea is simple. 
   
   1. The "Head" start at the middle (x,y)
   2. When user press right arrow, the snake should go X++
   3. When user press left arrow, the snake should go X--
   4. When user press top arrow, the snake should go Y++
   5. When user press bottom arrow, the snake should go Y--
   6. If the snake eat himself, it's game over, so i'm gonna use bool for this one.
   7. The goal is to eat cookie as many as possible, which will be generated random by using rand()
   8. Every time snake eats the cookie, it goes faster and longer, i'm gonna use nested if and nested loop
   
*The Progress / The Concept could change anytime by the Programmer's need.
  
                                                                                          -wlsonF
